# Quantum-Music_Syntax-error_2022
Creating progressive random music using quantum gates to provide pure randomness
Our goal is to create a website that could create random music of different instruments using quantum gates and algorithms
to provide with pure randomness.
The goal would be to use sophisticated algorithms like grover's search algorithm and basak-Miranda algorithm
But for now,we have used simple hadamard gates to produce random chords and rhythm,and play music via Sonicpi.
